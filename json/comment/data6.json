People, in general, are more aware of the risks, which makes the likelihood of another bubble lower. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The potential of the technology as a currency is great, but the global phenomenon was a get-rich-quick hysteria, and now that people have gotten burned, they&amp;#39;re less likely to try it again for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a currency, Bitcoin doesn&amp;#39;t need to have a value of $20k. What it really needs is to stabilize so that it can actually be used as a currency where the risk of holding that currency is low. Given the plethora of ways the value can be manipulated by people with enough coins or P&amp;amp;D groups, I&amp;#39;m not sure how that stability is going to be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just hoping I can buy a graphics card in the next 6 months for a reasonable price where the MSRP for a 2 year old card is lower than its debut MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dvw6ky4", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ay1x/serious_question_and_i_dont_mean_to_get_anyone/dvw6ky4/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521413987.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1521385187.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_85ay1x", "likes": null, "no_follow": false, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "modhash": "", "dist": null, "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 3, "name": "t1_dvwexgc", "id": "dvwexgc", "parent_id": "t1_dvw811x", "depth": 3, "children": ["dvwexgc"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dvw811x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "gasfjhagskd", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 9, "parent_id": "t1_dvw2z69", "score": 9, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "Let's just hope Tether doesn't explode...", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "noob", "collapsed": false, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just hope Tether doesn&amp;#39;t explode...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dvw811x", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ay1x/serious_question_and_i_dont_mean_to_get_anyone/dvw811x/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521415795.0, "author_flair_text": "redditor for 3 months", "created_utc": 1521386995.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"body": "Transaction fees could play a role.

In America we can drive in one direction for days and days and days and still find anything we need or want and pay for it with greenbacks and use our one card on anything and have it delivered and etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What crypto needs is USA adoption. For that to happen we need one of two things: Something with great demand that can only be bought with crypto, or something with great demand that gives a huge crypto discount. Like if Tesla said, &amp;quot;The new model 4 is only available for Bitcoin until nobody is ordering them with Bitcoin anymore,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;The model 3 now costs 25% less if you pay with Bitcoin.&amp;quot; That happens, BTC to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit_type": "public", "can_gild": true, "subreddit": "Bitcoin", "name": "t1_dvw7y0p", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bitcoin/comments/85ay1x/serious_question_and_i_dont_mean_to_get_anyone/dvw7y0p/", "num_reports": null, "stickied": false, "created": 1521415694.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1521386894.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bitcoin", "controversiality": 1, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s3qj", "approved_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_85ay1x", "likes": null, "no_follow": true, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dvwczgn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "TyberBTC", "can_mod_post": false, "ups": 1, "parent_id": "t1_dvw2l7f", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "downs": 0, "body": "We have more developed networks, pending mainnet releases from several major platforms, larger exchanges, new scaling solutions, government acceptance, better wallets, more institutional investors, etc, etc. \n\nThere are a lot of positive metrics.
